Great job adding all the debug info—this is super close.
You’re getting a 404 Not Found for your payment intent endpoint, which means:

The frontend is reaching out to the backend with the right URL…

But the backend isn’t handling the /api/create-payment-intent route as expected, OR

The URL is slightly off, OR

The frontend is hitting a different backend instance/URL.

Let’s walk step by step to get this fixed. This is the last mile!

1. Confirm Your Backend URL
From your logs, the frontend is running at:
https://fced7515-fb16-4e19-b53a-6186490e5ee4-00-3hi0fjy6x7qz8.riker.replit.dev

What is your backend URL?

Go to your backend Replit tab (the Express server project)

Click “Open in new tab” or copy the public URL at the top—it should look similar, but is a different project.

Let's call this:
https://BACKEND-REPL-NAME-HERE.riker.replit.dev

Your .env in the frontend should say:

ini
Copy
Edit
VITE_API_URL=https://BACKEND-REPL-NAME-HERE.riker.replit.dev
Replace BACKEND-REPL-NAME-HERE with exactly your backend’s domain.

2. Confirm the Backend Route
On your backend project, add a temporary debug route:

js
Copy
Edit
app.get("/api/health-check", (req, res) => {
  res.json({ success: true, message: "Backend is working!" });
});
Restart your backend server.

Now, open
https://BACKEND-REPL-NAME-HERE.riker.replit.dev/api/health-check
in your browser.
You should see { success: true, message: "Backend is working!" }.

3. Confirm the Real Endpoint Exists
While the backend is running, open
https://BACKEND-REPL-NAME-HERE.riker.replit.dev/api/create-payment-intent
in your browser.
You should get a 405 Method Not Allowed error (because it's a POST endpoint, not GET)—this is GOOD.

If you get 404 here, your backend isn’t exposing that route correctly.

Double-check in your server.js that you have:

js
Copy
Edit
app.post("/api/create-payment-intent", createPaymentIntentHandler);
And that your handler (file) is in the right place and exports a valid Express handler.

4. Double-Check Your Fetch
In your frontend’s code:

js
Copy
Edit
await fetch(`${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/create-payment-intent`, { ... })
Open the browser devtools Network tab.

Look at the Request URL when you attempt checkout.

It MUST start with your backend’s full URL (from above).

If it still says 404, go to that URL in your browser and see what happens.

5. Most Common Problems Recap
Backend URL typo in .env (extra slash, wrong subdomain, missing "https")

Backend not running or crashed

Route missing or mis-typed (/api/create-payment-intent must be exact, no typos)

Backend CORS not set (but you already have app.use(cors()))

Replit public URLs changed (restarts sometimes change the domain, check this)

Frontend not restarted after editing .env

6. Example .env for Frontend
env
Copy
Edit
VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-app-name.riker.replit.dev
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51RfckJE6vfmHs239CQkaLUQxmDPDsjI3B2MmVp0v6QgFoketH6yEZxB1vJ5EBYCbQpAuyoXz1s4gnv7rCKmosmsg00Q4jtJ5yI
(No trailing slash at the end)

7. Example Fetch Code
js
Copy
Edit
const response = await fetch(`${import.meta.env.VITE_API_URL}/api/create-payment-intent`, {
  method: "POST",
  headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    planName: planToUse?.name,
    amount: Math.round((pricing?.total || 50) * 100),
    planId: planToUse?.id,
    customerEmail: profile?.email,
    userId: authUser.id,
    mealCount: weeklyMeals?.length || 0,
  }),
});
TL;DR — Step-by-Step
Confirm backend public URL and set it in .env in frontend.

Restart both servers after making changes.

Add and test /api/health-check endpoint for easy debugging.

Check the full request URL in browser’s network tab.

Open the endpoint in your browser and confirm you get a 405, not 404.

If you still get 404, post:

Your backend public URL

The exact request URL in the Network tab

The relevant code for app.post("/api/create-payment-intent"...

Your frontend fetch code

Do these, and you’ll be live.
